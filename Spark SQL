Spark SQL – Overview

Let us recap about Data Frame Operations. It is one of the 2 ways we can process Data Frames.

    Selection or Projection – select clause
    Filtering data – where clause
    Joins – join (supports outer join as well)
    Aggregations – group by and aggregations with support of functions such as sum, avg, min, max etc
    Sorting – order by
    Analytics Functions – aggregations, ranking and windowing functions

Problem Statement – Get daily product revenue

Here is the problem statement for which we will be exploring Data Frame APIs to come up with final solution.

    Get daily product revenue
    orders – order_id, order_date, order_customer_id, order_status
    order_items – order_item_id, order_item_order_id, order_item_product_id, order_item_quantity, order_item_subtotal, order_item_product_price
    Data is comma separated
    We will fetch data using spark.read.csv
    Apply type cast functions to convert fields into their original type where ever is applicable.




spark = SparkSession. \
  builder. \
  master('local'). \
  appName('CSV Example'). \
  getOrCreate()

orders = spark.read. \
  format('csv'). \
  schema('order_id int, order_date string, order_customer_id int, order_status string'). \
  load('/Users/itversity/Research/data/retail_db/orders')

orders.printSchema()
orders.show()

orderItems = spark.read. \
  format('csv'). \
  schema('''order_item_id int, 
            order_item_order_id int, 
            order_item_product_id int, 
            order_item_quantity int,
            order_item_subtotal float,
            order_item_product_price float
         '''). \
  load('/Users/itversity/Research/data/retail_db/order_items')

orderItems.printSchema()
orderItems.show()


--------------------------------------------------------------------

# In case you are using pycharm, first you need to create object of type SparkSession
spark = SparkSession. \
  builder. \
  master('local'). \
  appName('CSV Example'). \
  getOrCreate()

ordersCSV = spark.read. \
  csv('/public/retail_db/orders'). \
  toDF('order_id', 'order_date', 'order_customer_id', 'order_status')

orderItemsCSV = spark.read. \
  csv('/public/retail_db/order_items'). \
  toDF('order_item_id', 'order_item_order_id', 'order_item_product_id', 
       'order_item_quantity', 'order_item_subtotal', 'order_item_product_price')

from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, FloatType

orders = ordersCSV. \
  withColumn('order_id', ordersCSV.order_id.cast(IntegerType())). \
  withColumn('order_customer_id', ordersCSV.order_customer_id.cast(IntegerType()))

orders.printSchema()
orders.show()

orderItems = orderItemsCSV.\
    withColumn('order_item_id', orderItemsCSV.order_item_id.cast(IntegerType())). \
    withColumn('order_item_order_id', orderItemsCSV.order_item_order_id.cast(IntegerType())). \
    withColumn('order_item_product_id', orderItemsCSV.order_item_product_id.cast(IntegerType())). \
    withColumn('order_item_quantity', orderItemsCSV.order_item_quantity.cast(IntegerType())). \
    withColumn('order_item_subtotal', orderItemsCSV.order_item_subtotal.cast(FloatType())). \
    withColumn('order_item_product_price', orderItemsCSV.order_item_product_price.cast(FloatType()))

orderItems.printSchema()
orderItems.show()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



    We can register both orders and orderItems as temporary views.
        Switch to database in hive – spark.sql('use bootcampdemo')
        orders as orders – orders.createOrReplaceTempView('orders')
        orderItems as order_items – orderItems.createOrReplaceTempView('order_items')
        List tables – spark.sql('show tables').show()
        Describe table – spark.sql('describe orders').show()

Relationship with Hive

Let us see how Spark is related to Hive.

    Hive is a logical database on top of HDFS
    All hive databases, tables and even partitions are nothing but directories in HDFS
    We can create tables in Hive with column names and data types
    Table names, column names, data types, location, file format, delimiter information is considered as metadata
    This metadata is stored in metastore which is typically relational database such as MySQL, Postgres, Oracle etc
    Once table is created, data can be queried or processed using HiveQL
    HiveQL will be compiled into Spark or Map Reduce job based on the execution engine.
    If Hive is integrated with Spark on the cluster using SparkSession object’s sql API we should be able to query and process data from Hive tables using Spark engine
    Query output will be converted to Data Frame
    SparkSession object’s sql API can execute standard hive commands such as show tables, show functions etc
    Standard Hive commands (except SQL)
        spark is of type SparkSession
        List of tables – spark.sql("show tables").show()
        Switch database – spark.sql("use bootcampdemo").show()
        Describe table – spark.sql("describe table orders").show()
        Show functions – for f in spark.sql("show functions").collect(): print(f)
        Describe function – for f in spark.sql("describe function substring").collect(): print(f)
    We can also create/drop tables, insert/load data into tables using Hive syntax as part of sql function of SparkSession object
    As part of SparkSession object’s read, there is an API which facilitate us to read raw data from Hive table into Data Frame
    write package of data frame provides us APIs such as saveAsTable, insertInto etc to directly write data frame into Hive table.

Selection or Projection – select clause

Now let us see how we can project data the way we want using select.

    We can run queries directly from hive tables or register data frames as temporary views/tables.
    We can use select and fetch data from the fields we are looking for.
    We can represent data using DataFrame.ColumnName or directly ‘ColumnName’ in select clause – e.g.: spark.sql('select order_id, order_date from orders').show()
    We can apply necessary functions to manipulate data while it is being projected – spark.sql('select substring(order_date, 1, 7) from orders').show()
    We can give aliases to the derived fields using alias function – spark.sql('select substring(order_date, 1, 7) as order_month from orders').show()

Filtering data – where clause

We can use where clause to filter the data.

    One by using class.attributeName and comparing with values – e. g.: spark.sql('select * from orders where order_status = "COMPLETE"').show()
    Make sure both orders and orderItems data frames are created
    Let us see few more examples
        Get orders which are either COMPLETE or CLOSED
        Get orders which are either COMPLETE or CLOSED and placed in month of 2013 August
        Get order items where order_item_subtotal is not equal to product of order_item_quantity and order_item_product_price
        Get all the orders which are placed on first of every month


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Get orders which are either COMPLETE or CLOSED
spark.sql('select * from orders where order_status = "COMPLETE" or order_status = "CLOSED"').show()
spark.sql('select * from orders where order_status in ("COMPLETE", "CLOSED")').show()


# Get orders which are either COMPLETE or CLOSED and placed in month of 2013 August

spark.sql('select * from orders where order_status in ("COMPLETE", "CLOSED") and order_date like "2013-08%"').show()

# Get order items where order_item_subtotal is not equal to product of order_item_quantity and order_item_product_price
spark.sql('''select * from order_items where 
             order_item_subtotal != round(order_item_quantity * order_item_product_price, 2)''').show()

# Get all the orders which are placed on first of every month
spark.sql('''select * from orders 
             where date_format(order_date, "dd") = "01"''').show()



Joining Data Sets

Quite often we need to deal with multiple data sets which are related with each other.

    We need to first understand the relationship with respect to data sets
    All our data sets have relationships defined between them.
        orders and order_items are transaction tables. orders is parent and order_items is child. Relationship is established between the two using order_id (in order_items, it is represented as order_item_order_id)
        We also have product catalog normalized into 3 tables – products, categories and departments (with relationships established in that order)
        We also have customers table
        There is relationship between customers and orders – customers is parent data set as one customer can place multiple orders.
        There is relationship between product catalog and order_items via products – products is parent data set as one product can be ordered as part of multiple order_items.
    Determine the type of join – inner or outer (left or right or full)
    We can perform joins using ascii syntax with join along with on clause
    We can also perform outer joins (left or right or full)
    Let us see few examples
        Get all the order items corresponding to COMPLETE or CLOSED orders
        Get all the orders where there are no corresponding order_items
        Check if there are any order_items where there is no corresponding order in orders data set


# Get all the order items corresponding to COMPLETE or CLOSED orders

spark.sql('select * from orders o join order_items oi '
          'on o.order_id = oi.order_item_order_id '
          'where o.order_status in ("COMPLETE", "CLOSED")'). \
show()

# Get all the orders where there are no corresponding order_items

spark.sql('select * from orders o left outer join order_items oi '
          'on o.order_id = oi.order_item_order_id '
          'where oi.order_item_order_id is null'). \
show()

# Check if there are any order_items where there is no corresponding order in orders data set

spark.sql('select * from orders o right outer join order_items oi '
          'on o.order_id = oi.order_item_order_id '
          'where o.order_id is null'). \
show()



Aggregations using group by and functions

Many times we want to perform aggregations such as sum, average, minimum, maximum etc with in each group. We need to first group the data and then perform aggregation.

    group by is the function which can be used to group the data on one or more columns
    Once data is grouped we can perform all supported aggregations – sum, avg, min, max etc
    Let us see few examples
        Get count by status from orders
        Get revenue for each order id from order items
        Get daily product revenue (order_date and order_item_product_id are part of keys, order_item_subtotal is used for aggregation)


# Get count by status from orders
spark.sql('select order_status, count(1) status_count '
          'from orders group by order_status'). \
show()

# Get revenue for each order id from order items 
spark.sql('select order_item_order_id, sum(order_item_subtotal) order_revenue '
          'from order_items group by order_item_order_id'). \
show()

# Get daily product revenue 
# filter for complete and closed orders
# groupBy order_date and order_item_product_id
# Use agg and sum on order_item_subtotal to get revenue

spark.conf.set('spark.sql.shuffle.partitions', '2')

spark.sql('select o.order_date, oi.order_item_product_id, '
          'sum(oi.order_item_subtotal) order_revenue '
          'from orders o join order_items oi '
          'on o.order_id = oi.order_item_order_id '
          'where o.order_status in ("COMPLETE", "CLOSED") '
          'group by o.order_date, oi.order_item_product_id'). \
show()


Sorting data

Now let us see how we can sort the data using sort or orderBy.

    order by can be used to sort the data
    We can perform composite sorting by using multiple fields
    By default data will be sorted in ascending order
    We can change the order by using desc
    Let us see few examples
        Sort orders by status
        Sort orders by date and then by status
        Sort order items by order_item_order_id and order_item_subtotal descending
        Take daily product revenue data and sort in ascending order by date and then descending order by revenue.


spark.sql('''select * from orders 
             order by order_status''').show()


#Sort orders by date and then by status
spark.sql('''select * from orders 
             order by order_date, order_status''').show()

# Sort order items by order_item_order_id and order_item_subtotal descending
spark.sql('''select * from order_items 
             order by order_item_order_id, order_item_subtotal desc''').show()


# Take daily product revenue data and 
# sort in ascending order by date and 
# then descending order by revenue.

spark.conf.set('spark.sql.shuffle.partitions', '2')

dailyProductRevenue = spark.sql('''select o.order_date, oi.order_item_product_id, 
             round(sum(oi.order_item_subtotal), 2) as revenue
             from orders o join order_items oi
             on o.order_id = oi.order_item_order_id
             where o.order_status in ("COMPLETE", "CLOSED")
             group by o.order_date, oi.order_item_product_id
             order by o.order_date, revenue desc''')

dailyProductRevenue.show()
